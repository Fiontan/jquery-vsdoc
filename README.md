For those new to using Visual Studio with jQuery, the vsdoc version of the file allows Visual Studio to use Intellisense for jQuery development. The vsdoc file contains xml annotations, within javascript comments, which allow Visual Studio to parse, interpret and provide Intellisense while working with Javascript files, and in this case, jQuery.

If you're still using Visual Studio 2008 and haven't yet updated it with the latest Service Pack, you'll need to do so before being able to make use of the extended Intellisense for Javascript. You can get SP1 for Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2008 Express here (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/cc533448.aspx).
